## About Me

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I am interested in understanding complex dynamical systems, and my current research focuses on the formation and evolution of snowbands in winter cyclones. As part of the science team on the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms [IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts), I use observations collected from aircraft-mounted instruments to improve both numerical models and detection of snowfall from space. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Lynn McMurdie](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnm/wordpress/).

I have also worked with [Dr. Colin Goldblatt](http://www.colingoldblatt.net/) at the [University of Victoria](https://seos.uvic.ca) on paleoclimate using global climate models, investigating the role of low cloud feedbacks in regulating Earth's surface temperature. Our results from this study are currently under review.

My interests are broad, and my years spent working in the geospatial software industry before starting my PhD have left me with a strong interest in making better tools for analyzing and visualizing massive, earth-scale datasets, and I hope to do more work in this area again soon.
