Every year snowstorms cause millions of dollars in property damage, economic loss, and personal injury by causing major traffic accidents, shutting down cities, grounding air traffic, and causing power outages. Improving forecasts of both the location and intensity of snowfall is critical for communities to be able to adequately prepare for and mitigate the effects of major snowstorms. And we have the technology to help. The Investigation of Microphysics of Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) is a five-year Earth Venture Suborbital (EVS-3) NASA project led by UW Research Associate Professor Lynn McMurdie. Over the course of three deployments, two aircraft and a host of mobile ground crews go storm chasing to collect critical new observations that will elucidate how and why snowfall organizes into narrow bands of heavy precipitation. Understanding the processes that contribute to snow band formation and life cycle is the first goal, but equally important is applying what we learn to improve both forecasting in numerical models, and detection of snowfall from space.  

Our first deployment was held in January and February 2020. Over the course of 6 weeks, we collected observations in 10 storms. During each event the high-altitude NASA ER-2 aircraft flew above the storm in the stratosphere. Equipped with three active radars, two passive radars, and one LiDAR, it essentially acted as a satellite whose movement we could control. Simultaneously, the NASA P-3 aircraft flew at different altitudes inside the clouds and took measurements of liquid and frozen water content in clouds, and images of snow and ice particles with various microphysics probes. The P-3 also used dropsondes and turbulence sensors to collect information about the broader environment. Mobile ground units drove to where the storms were forecasted to hit hardest, and deployed additional radars and rawinsondes to complete the picture.

I travelled to Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, where the P-3 and the operations center were based, to help with storm forecasting. Winter cyclones can occur at any time of day or night, so multiple people were needed to constantly watch the weather models and airport conditions so that we could optimize flight time without getting snowed in and having our own aircraft grounded. UW Postdoctoral Researcher Joe Finlon led the forecasting effort. From coordinating the forecasting process to designing an automated weather briefing template, he led a team of forecasters from NASA Goddard and several Universities, including students working with UW Alum Professors Brian Colle (SUNY Stony Brook) and Sandra Yuter (North Carolina State University), and fellow UW graduate student Andrew DeLaFrance. With rapidly changing weather conditions and occasional back to back storms over multiple days, the operations center could get quite hectic at times while we tried to determine which models to trust and plan flight routes that would give us the best chance of being in the right position to intercept snowbands. I came to UW with no background in meteorology, so being thrown into the deep end of an active high stakes forecasting mission was an invaluable experience that I am grateful to have been part of.  

IMPACTS is set to continue in 2021 and 2022, although with COVID-19 still posing a significant threat to in-person work, we are adjusting plans to ensure safe working conditions and minimal threats of exposure for everyone. Plans are still being finalized to allow the mission to go forward this year, and analysis has already begun on the initial observations from this past year. With the help of UWâ€™s Stacy Brodzik, who is the IMPACTS Data Manager, datasets from the 2020 storms are now available publicly, and can be accessed at https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_details/collections/impactsC.html. You can learn more about IMPACTS at https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts/content/IMPACTS, and http://catalog.eol.ucar.edu/impacts_2020, and can follow us on twitter (@snowIMPACTS) and Facebook (Snow_IMPACTS) as we go forward with our next deployments in 2021 and 2022.
