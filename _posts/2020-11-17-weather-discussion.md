Hurricane Iota
------

This year has been a record breaker for a lot of extreme weather, and most recently, it's hurricanes that are making headlines every week. We're seeing the devastating effects of climate change as storms become more frequent, more intense, and slower to die out. 
This image from the Weather Channel shows all of the named storms we've had this year, and this doesn't even include Hurricane Iota down in the Caribbean!

Iota broke records by being the 30th named storm this year. It is extremely late in the season for such an intense hurricane. Below is a radar loop of Iota organizing on Sunday.

The forecast path and timeline was fairly accurate, although Iota did end up slightly south of where it was forecast and made landfall a little late. Here is the forecast on Sunday for time and location of landfall, and below that is the actual path that it tracked. Iota made landfall on Mondey evening.

So let's talk about how Iota became such a monster hurricane. As Iota travelled westward, it moved through warm oceans and low wind shear. In the image below you can see that while wind shear in the hurricane itself is strong, the whole surrounding area has very low shear. This keeps the cyclone vertically stacked as it intensifies

Iota moved almost in a straight line to the west and didn't really curve much at all before making landfall. This is due to the strong high pressure anomaly that is sitting in the Gulf of Mexico and over Florida. This type of pattern will have northeasterly winds pushing the cyclone to the southwest as it tries to curve northward, and this keeps it moving directly to the west.

As the hurricane approached Central America it looks absolutely beautiful and dangerous in the satellite imagery. This is a textbook cyclone that intensified to category 5 with strong winds, high outflow, intense convection on the northern side of the eyewall, and very low pressure in the center of the eye. Recon aircraft measured 917 hPa, which is lower (more intense) than Hurricane Katrina and the strongest hurricane of 2020.

Here's a nice visualization of just how intense hurricane Iota got. This plot shows the 36 hour wind change in knots from 1851 to 2019, with three of 2020's storms overlaid, Delta, Eta, and Iota. Iota's winds increased 85 kts in 36 hours, which is extremely high, and very rare for this late in the season.

Iota did weaken slightly as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, which downgraded it to officially land as a category 4 hurricane. Eyewall replacelemt cycles are fairly common in large hurricanes, and occur when some of the outer rainbands organize into a ring around the eyewall, which cuts off the moisture supply and suffocates the eyewall. The outer ring squeezes into and eventually replaces the inner eyewall, but during this process the max winds ease up a little as they expand over a larger radius and make sort of a fatter donut around the eye. This is beautifully visualized by Tomer Burg with the recon data - and I recommend following him on Twitter ([@burgwx](https://twitter.com/burgwx) for more great storm content. The first image below is a hovmoller diagram which shows flight-level winds with the azimuthaly averaged radius on the x-axis and time on the y-axis. The storm intensifies to a maximum around 16-17 UTC on Monday in the eyewall at 25km radis (the light peach colors). At the top of this figure, the intensity dies down a little and the radius expands out a bit further - this is the eyewall replacement cycle happening.

It's a little more clear when we look at it in map view as in the sequence below. The inner core develops and intensifies into a really beautiful and tight eyewall, and then just as the storm gets close to land the intensity drops and the region of max wind expands outwards over a broader area.

Iota made landfall on Monday evening, just south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, and only 15 miles from where Hurricane Eta landed just two weeks prior. Having two intense category 4 hurricanes land in pretty well exactly the same location is absolutely devastating. With 20 ft storm surge and 30 inches of rainfall on top of the destruction and flooding from Eta, hurricane Iota has been labelled unsurvivable. This is a total disastor and a humanitarian emergency. These intense storms will continue to become more frequent and more destructive under human-caused climate change, and areas like Nicaragua that have contributed little to anthropogenic emissions will continue to bear the brunt of the destruction.
