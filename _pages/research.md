Winter Stormchasing in the Northeastern US
======
The Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms ([IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts)) is a five-year Earth Venture Suborbital (EVS-3) NASA aircraft-based field campaign to collect simultaneous remote sensing and mid-cloud observations of Northeastern U.S. winter storms. Using 3 active radars, 2 passive radars, lidar, microphysics probes, turbulence sensors, dropsondes, as well as a host of ground crews, we are able to get a comprehensive view of snowstorms for the first time in over 30 years.  

NE US snowstorms commonly exhibit linear banded patterns of heavier precipition within areas of lighter precipitation in the storm. We call these structures 'snowbands', and one of the major goals of this field campaign is to better understand the processes that control how the snowbands are initiated and evolve during the lifetime of the storm. Our work will ultimately result in better, more accurate forecasts of both the location and timing of heavy snowfall, which will help emergency response and community planning in one of the most densely populated regions of North America. 

My role during field deployments is mainly as a forecaster, but I have also flown on the NASA P-3 as an onboard scientist. 
For my thesis, I use both the radar observations we collect from the aircraft and turbulence resolving numerical models to study the dynamics of the three dimensional wind field, and how it contributes to the organization and evolution of snowbands.

Climate Modelling to Study Ancient Clouds
======

For my undergraduate research I performed a series of global climate model experiments where, by decreasing the amount of sunlight and increasing the carbon dioxide in the model atmosphere to compensate (thus keeping the global average surface temperature the same as today), we get a first order approximation of the climate during the Archean (~ 2.5 - 4 billion years ago). We found that under these conditions the low stratocumulus cloud amount decreases significantly compared to present day conditions. This allows a higher fraction of the available sunlight to reach the surface, contributing ~40% of the heating required to counteract the decreased solar intensity and avoid widespread glaciation. This is a new physical mechanism that helps resolve the Faint Young Sun problem, allowing the geochemical feedbacks that have been relied on in previous studies to play a smaller role, and stay within the ranges allowed by proxies.
Our results are currently in press at Nature Geoscience.
