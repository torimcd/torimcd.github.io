Winter Stormchasing in the Northeastern US
======
The Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms ([IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts)) is a five-year Earth Venture Suborbital (EVS-3) NASA aircraft-based field campaign to collect simultaneous remote sensing and mid-cloud observations of Northeastern U.S. winter storms. Using 3 active radars, 2 passive radars, lidar, microphysics probes, turbulence sensors, dropsondes, as well as a host of ground crews, we are able to get a comprehensive view of snowstorms for the first time in over 30 years.  

My role in the field is mainly as a forecaster, but I have also flown on the NASA P-3 as an onboard scientist. Outside of winter deployments I am using the data we collect to understand how the dynamics and kinematics of these storms contribute to the organization and evolution of snowbands.

Climate Modelling to Study Ancient Clouds
======

For my undergraduate research I performed a series of climate model experiments where, by decreasing the amount of sunlight and increasing the carbon dioxide in the model atmosphere to compensate (keeping the global average surface temperature the same as today), we get a first order idea of the climate during the Archean (~ 2.5 - 4 billion years ago). We found that under these conditions the low stratocumulus cloud amount decreases significantly compared to present day conditions. This allows a higher fraction of the available sunlight to reach the surface, contributing ~40% of the heating required to counteract the decreased solar intensity and avoid widespread glaciation. This is a new physical mechanism that helps resolve the Faint Young Sun problem, allowing the geochemical feedbacks that have been relied on in previous studies to play a smaller role, and stay within the ranges allowed by proxies.
Our results are currently in review at Nature Geoscience.
