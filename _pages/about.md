## About Me

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I am interested in understanding complex dynamical systems, and my current research focuses on the formation and evolution of snowbands in winter cyclones. As part of the science team on the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms [IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts), I use observations collected from aircraft-mounted instruments to improve both numerical models and detection of snowfall from space. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Lynn McMurdie](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnm/wordpress/).

I have ongoing collaborations with [Dr. Colin Goldblatt](http://www.colingoldblatt.net/) at the [University of Victoria](https://seos.uvic.ca), where we study paleoclimate using global climate models to uncover the role of low cloud feedbacks in regulating Earth's surface temperature. Our recent results are currently under review.

Before starting my PhD I worked in the geospatial software industry. This background continues to motivate broad interests, and building better tools for analyzing and visualizing massive, earth-scale datasets is an area I hope to do more work in again soon.
