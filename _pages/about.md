I am a graduate student and scientist in the [Department of Atmospheric Science](https://atmos.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. My research focuses on the dynamics controlling the formation and evolution of snowbands in winter cyclones. As part of the science team on the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms [IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts), I use observations collected from aircraft-mounted instruments to better understand winter storms. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Lynn McMurdie](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnm/wordpress/).

I have also worked with [Dr. Colin Goldblatt](http://www.colingoldblatt.net/) on the paleoclimate modelling with global climate models, investigating the role of low cloud feedbacks in regulating Earth's climate. Our results from this work are in currently in review at Nature Geoscience.

My interests are broad, and after working in the geospatial software industry for a number of years before starting my PhD I've retained a strong interest in making better tools for analyzing and visualizing massive, earth-scale datasets,
