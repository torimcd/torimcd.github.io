I am a graduate student and scientist in the [Department of Atmospheric Science](https://atmos.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. My current research focuses on understanding the dynamics controlling the formation and evolution of snowbands in winter cyclones. As part of the science team on the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms [IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts), I use observations collected from aircraft-mounted instruments to better understand winter storms. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Lynn McMurdie](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnm/wordpress/).

I have also worked with [Dr. Colin Goldblatt](http://www.colingoldblatt.net/) at the [University of Victoria](https://seos.uvic.ca) on paleoclimate using global climate models, investigating the role of low cloud feedbacks in regulating Earth's surface temperature. Our results from this study are currently in review at Nature Geoscience.

My interests are broad, and my years spent working in the geospatial software industry before starting my PhD has left me with a strong interest in making better tools for analyzing and visualizing massive, earth-scale datasets, and I hope to do more work in this area again soon.
