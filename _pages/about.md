## About Me

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I am broadly interested in understanding complex dynamical systems, and my current research focuses on how the wind influences precipitation in severe winter storms. As part of the science team for the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation in Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms [IMPACTS](https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts), I use aircraft-mounted instruments to measure the motion of cloud droplets and ice particles during these cyclones, and use these to study the mesoscale kinematics of the 3-dimensional wind field. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Lynn McMurdie](https://faculty.washington.edu/lynnm/wordpress/).

I have ongoing collaborations with [Dr. Colin Goldblatt](http://www.colingoldblatt.net/) at the [University of Victoria](https://seos.uvic.ca), where we study paleoclimate using global climate models to better understand the role of cloud feedbacks in regulating Earth's surface temperature. Our recent results are being published in Nature Geoscience.

I have also previously worked in the geospatial software industry. This background continues to motivate broad interests, and building better tools for analyzing and visualizing massive, earth-scale datasets is an area I hope to do more work in again soon.
